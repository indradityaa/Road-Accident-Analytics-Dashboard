# Road Accident Data Analysis (Interactive Dashboard using MS Excel)

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to create an interactive **Road Accident Dashboard** for the years **2021 and 2022**. The dashboard helps clients analyze accident and casualty data, compare year-over-year (YoY) performance, and gain insights into accident patterns based on severity, vehicle type, road type, location, and time conditions. These insights support better road safety planning and data-driven decision-making.

## Dataset used
* <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/152Tb2wcypk_McBYm6Ws9jXaJZfsusOV6/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100467937552408917995&rtpof=true&sd=true">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)

### Primary KPIs

* Total casualties and total accident values for the **current year** with **year-over-year (YoY) growth**.
* Total casualties by **accident severity** for the current year with YoY growth.

### Secondary KPIs & Analysis

* Total casualties with respect to **vehicle type** for the current year.
* **Monthly trend** comparing casualties for the current year vs previous year.
* Casualties by **road type** for the current year.
* Current year casualties by **area/location** and by **day/night** conditions.
* Total casualties and total accidents by **location**.

## Process

* Collected and reviewed road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022.
* Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and standardizing data formats.
* Created calculated fields to derive YoY growth and key performance indicators.
* Built pivot tables to analyze casualties and accidents across multiple dimensions.
* Designed an interactive Excel dashboard integrating all KPIs.
* Applied slicers and filters to enable dynamic year-wise and category-wise analysis.

## Project Insights

* Clear year-over-year comparison highlights trends in accident frequency and casualty counts.
* Accident severity analysis helps identify the most critical contributors to total casualties.
* Vehicle type and road type breakdowns reveal high-risk segments.
* Monthly and day/night trends provide visibility into peak accident periods.
* Location-based analysis supports targeted safety interventions.

## Final Conclusion

This Road Accident dashboard provides a comprehensive view of accident and casualty trends across 2021 and 2022. By analyzing YoY growth, severity levels, vehicle involvement, and temporal patterns, stakeholders can identify high-risk areas and time periods. These insights can be leveraged to improve road safety measures, optimize policy decisions, and reduce accident-related casualties through targeted actions.
